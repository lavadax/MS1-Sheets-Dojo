            <h4>What is Google Sheets and why should I use it?</h4>
            <p>Google Sheets is a free, could-based spreadsheet application. If that doesn't say much for you, think Microsoft Excel with some changes.</p>
            <p>The strongest point of Google Sheets, is the fact that it's cloud based, which means your files will always be updated no matter where you are, and collaborating with people is much easier.</p>
            <p>The first thing we have to do before we can get started, is opening <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a> and creating a new spreadsheet. To get started on a blank sheet, click on the big '+' in the top left as indicated in the image below.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/newsheet.png">
            <p>A few things to note before we start working in our sheet. Before we start using any formulas, we need to understand how we can refer to specific cells so we can use them in our formulas. Sheets uses a grid system, so a cell reference is determined by the column and row it is in, much like in chess or battleship.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/cellreference.png">
            <p>The last thing before we start working: expect to make mistakes. No need to worry, simply press CTRL + Z (or CMD + Z on Mac) and you'll revert back one step.</p>
            <h3 id="beginner">Beginner</h3>
            <p>I think we can all imagine (to some extent) what a spreadsheet is used for: data tables. I'll be skipping over what they look like as this guide will be mostly focused on functions and formulas, but if you're interested in this just contact me <a href="contact.html">here</a> and I can add it later.</p>
            <h4>Formulas</h4>
            <p>In order to start using a formula, you have to first put an equal sign (=) in the cell before adding your formula. This is pretty much the same as using a calculator, so make sure to keep the priority rules (PEMDAS / BEDMAS / BODMAS / BIDMAS) in mind before throwing random numbers in your spreadsheet.</p>
            <p>For example, if you type "=10/2" in a cell, it will show 5. you can see the formula in the formula bar on top, while the result is in the cell as you can see below.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/formula.png">
            <h4>Basic Functions</h4>
            <p>There are many functions in Google Sheets, but we have to start somewhere. In this section we'll be discussing COUNT, SUM and AVERAGE.</p>
            <p>Click on cell B8, type an equals (=) and then start typing the word COUNT. You’ll notice an auto-complete menu comes up showing all of the functions beginning with C, like this:</p>
            <img src="assets/images/count.png">
            <p>You can either keep typing COUNT in full, or find it and select in from the list (hover over it and click on it OR hit enter OR hit tab). Next you’ll see a question mark to the left of the cell.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/helper1.png">
            <p>Clicking this will open the formula helper, which tells you about the formula syntax and how to fill it in correctly:</p>
            <img src="assets/images/helper2.png">
            <p>In this case, the COUNT function is expecting a list of numeric values.</p>
            <p>You have to select the range of cells you want to count. So click on B4, hold you mouse down and drag down to B7, so that the four cells are highlighted in orange and B4:B7 is showing up in your function: Then, close the function with a closing bracket “)”: =COUNT(B4:B7)</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that COUNT is used to count numbers. If you want to count anything else, COUNT will give you a 0, so you'll have to use COUNTA instead.</p>
            <p>If we translate the above example to a real world example, COUNT would tell us how many members our gym has. Another important piece of information would be how much money our gym is earning monthly.</p>
            <p>To calculate this, we need to use the SUM function on the monthly fees. in D8, type =SUM(D4:D7) and the result will be our total monthly income as such:</p>
            <img src="assets/images/sum.png">
            <p>Another interesting thing we could find with the data we have collected, is how much members pay on average. start typing =AVERAGE(D4:D8) in D9 and we'll find out the answer.</p>
