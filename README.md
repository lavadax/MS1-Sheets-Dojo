<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)


### Built With

* [Bootstrap 4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used to assist responsiveness and streamline the positioning & styling of the site.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) / [Gitpod Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) - Used to develop the site and push the project to Github.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used to add icons for social media links.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) - Used to host the project during and after development.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to set up the wireframes at the start of the dev cycle.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Used as an alternative to Gitpod to develop the site and push the project to Github after running out of free time on Gitpod.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

### Future Plans

* [Enhance index.html styling to look more professional.](https://github.com/lavadax/MS1-Sheets-Dojo/issues/7)
* Add guide to guide.html.
* Add input field for other subjects, hidden by default, unhidden when "other" subject is selected.

### Open Issues

See the [open issues](https://github.com/lavadax/MS1-Sheets-Dojo/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

### Past issues

* [Top and bottom padding would start increasing before the screen would go past the height of the document, adding unnecessary whitespace.](https://github.com/lavadax/MS1-Sheets-Dojo/issues/7)
* I ran out of time on Gitpod using my free account, so I had to swap from Gitpod to Atom near the end of the project.
* Had to use vh for top/bottom padding in the contact form, as using % is seemingly based on width of the element, instead of height.
* [Positioning of nav in header caused the nav to overflow from the header, creating whitespace on the right at screen widths below 340px.](https://github.com/lavadax/MS1-Sheets-Dojo/issues/3)  
* [Width rules for all footer sections conflicted with the built-in bootstrap breakpoints, causing the center section to get pushed down on the screen.](https://github.com/lavadax/MS1-Sheets-Dojo/issues/5)  
* The default negative margin of Bootstrap rows caused white space on the bottom and right of the page on screen widths of 575 pixels and below.  
* Top nav bar spacing would overlap on extra small screen sizes, requiring a modified spacing solution by form of media query to ensure proper functionality down to screen widths of 280px.  
* Adding "/" in readme headers stopped table of contents from redirecting correctly. Had to remove all symbols to ensure functionality.  
* Project started on different repository, but after several days of testing, making edits to the master branch directly proved to be too risky. New repository was created as a safety precaution.
